# Abstract

Developmental science poses some of the most profound problems in all of science and some of the most difficult ones.
Because the answers are so important, it's essential that researchers do everything possible to accelerate discovery and promote reproducibility and rigor.
In this essay, we argue that embracing open practices will achieve the goals of making developmental science more reproducible, rigorous, and robust while simultaneously accelerating discovery.

# Body

Where is developmental science going? 
That is one way to restate the theme of this special issue.
Questions about trajectories are central to our field, but most of us are probably more comfortable prognosticating about topics other than our own area of inquiry.
Indeed, rather than predict the future, we prefer to describe what we hope to see and why.
In this essay, we argue that developmental science poses some of the most profound and important questions in all of science.
While the sciences of human behavior are often thought to be less rigorous than some more mature sciences, the reality is that studying the causes and consequences of behavior and their trajectories over time poses some of the most difficult scientific problems we know.
Answering hard and important questions demands the utmost rigor, and yet we find that conventional practices in developmental science undermine that rigor and worse, slow the pace of discovery.
So, we recommend that our colleagues adopt, embrace, and promote open science practices that will strengthen the field: open sharing of research data; open sharing of research procedures and methods; improved clarity in reporting; and renewing the focus on observable behavior.

## Recommendations

Risks to robustness across the research cycle (Munafo).

### Sharing data

- Make data sharing the norm, not the exception
- Plan for data sharing from the outset of a project.
- Make data a first class scholarly product, not the by-product.
- Make all data shared in forms that permit easy verification of main findings
    - openly shared, scriptable analysis pipelines
    - well-curated
    - standardized metadata with schema
    - accessible via scriptable APIs
- Adding post-review data verification

- Share data only with participant permission and with restricted audiences

### Sharing methods

- Ask yourself this question: How likely is it that another person could reproduce your study on the basis of your published paper and supplemental materials?
- Beyond pre-registration
  - Focuses on one set of problems

### Improving clarity

1. What was done and why
2. What behavior(s) and internal states or external to the individual factors were measured
3. What causal model(s) are researchers considering? Which are they testing?

### Make behavior the focus

- Internal states + behaviors
- Video & audio

## Conclusions

- Open practices are less difficult than they are often perceived to be
- Open practices benefit the practitioner
- Open practices benefit the science
- Open practices benefit society
